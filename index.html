        <p>A week ago my neighbor sent me a text indicating that some of my chickens</br>were on his property.</p>
        <img src="file:///C:/Users/Family-Laptop/Documents/Jose/Launchcode/lc101/html-me-something/images/chickens.jpg" alt="Chickens on the loose" height="500" width="500">
        <p>These chickens have a coop and have a fenced chicken run (the building with the <br> green roof on the upper left of the photo is 
            our <a href="file:///C:/Users/Family-Laptop/Documents/Jose/Launchcode/lc101/html-me-something/images/Barn.jpg" alt="barn" height="500" width="500">barn</a> where their <a href=images/coop.jpg alt="coop" height="500" width="500">coop</a> is.)  
            But<br> they have scratched and clawed all the vegetation in their
            area which is now<br>just a patch of dirt.  The chickens now often fly over their fence into the neighbor's<br>yard seeking greener spaces. </p>
        

        <p>Because they were flying over the fence searching for vegetation so often,<br> 
            we would open the gate to allow them on to our pasture, hoping they would stay<br>on our property!
            But rather than stay on our pasture, they crawled under the fence<br>and into the neighbor's yard.<br>

        <p>My neighbor is an urban transplant from Baltimore....... </p>

        <p>To appease our neighbor, we extended the fence to make it more difficult for the<br> chickens to enter the neighbor's yard.
        Notice how the chickens are now on our <br>side of the property.  Before the chickens would have crossed over into the neighbor's<br> property from that point.</p>

        <p> However, the work continues because the chickens can still fly over the fence.<br>
        So I need to raise the height of the fence to make that more difficult.  I intend to<br>
        do this by attaching lattice fencing on top of the present fence.</p>

        <p>In the end, a taller fence may not fully solve the problem.  But if we can keep<br>most of the chickens on our side and maintain
        good relations with the occasional<br>delivery of fresh eggs to our neighbors, I think things will work out. </p>
