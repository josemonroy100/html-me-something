        <h1>How To Keep Your Animals Inside Your Property!</h1>
        <h3>(And avoid annoying your neighbors!)</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>A week ago my neighbor sent me a text indicating that some of my chickens were on his property.</p>
        <img src="chickens.jpg" alt="Chickens on the loose" height="500" width="500">
        <p>These chickens have a coop and have a fenced chicken run (the building with the <br> green roof on the upper left of the photo is our <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fbP2hApHMgIZm24WmiuJ2gI3DVTPU35LUlUH28GE_tqifmt5n-lu8Qz9FlzBp1amgaEUHhkQ_CS_peNRWgItLk6EkvZfIgr1dgHoFauM-YHbLK8cX4_Vc4zK2xZui5EmISBllweOD1W-TbQLFuzqrIUjnZkR7m4wwX1k8VLXaPTifPo9pCF7_V2eGs8tB6L_-9AF2PmWg7LIyCaYqeDxfLTT6m6rr6rcgrrKHpKIMdcjPKfftZ-fKA-L0Bt5pVaGiL6ybUfmJox6Y3mwBPybQNjbCePMUg2n5accvGaZLXoDCHydASlxxvTsgcXeVB3Mj_cpaYQolJj5R6rrvP7PQLulYOUjNRvKwLn205sBv7k6vuAlpSOFcHPR60xgllnbw0tWbQ0y4lKLf4whvHJ6_qWwB41X6339kIZ_O601JRbtD8K7A4oMBIuhw3cX2k7FCNydlTu8axFZ8GalGq_9CI4MU8tUYgvFDBtX_SzXwi33BxIWTnPu9eH3kq0Bn55xMiJHcitaJ076U8KLMhy4fS-mAOj3-lFQcoEfBKrPN7Ca_Ny8mzu2_Fzu5b8pVRwBCvw4FXSzD1X2QESBFce6QUJrpbDKvSG0fNQJkpTNsOfmRa4LDrUGMlrM8dTRPccxcOsxgwMtcJIt006aITds1grL=w1205-h904-no" alt="barn" height="500" width="500">barn</a> where their coop is).  But<br> they have scratched and clawed all the vegetation in their
            area which is now<br>just a patch of dirt.  The chickens now often fly over their fence into the neighbor's<br>yard seeking greener spaces. </p>

        <p>To appease our neighbor, we extended the fence to make it more difficult for the<br> chickens to enter the neighbor's yard.
        Notice how the chickens are now on our <br>side of the property.  Before the chickens would have crossed over into the neighbor's<br> property from that point.</p>

        <p> However, the work continues because the chickens can still fly over the fence.<br>
        So I need to raise the height of the fence to make that more difficult.  I intend to<br>
        do this by attaching lattice fencing on top of the present fence.</p>

        <p>In the end, a taller fence may not fully solve the problem.  But if we can keep<br>most of them on our side and maintain
        good relations by regularly delivering<br>eggs to our neighbors, I think things will work out. </p>
